# TUBITAK - FALL DETECTION SYSTEM WITH DEEP LEARNING METHODS
In this TÜBİTAK-supported project, I was responsible for the hardware integration and software development of the ESP32-CAM and accelerometer components used in the fall detection system. In the system, when a sudden movement or fall is detected through accelerometer data, the ESP32-CAM module is triggered to capture an image of the environment. The captured image is then sent to an AI model based on YOLO and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for fall detection
